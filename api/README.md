This is a Eng<->Mon Eng->Eng dictionary dedicated for Mongolian sister and brothers.

To start the app, make sure you are in mango-mobile/api directory.

Then run, 
`npm start`

To test if the build is successful, running:

`curl --location --request GET 'localhost:3000/dict/en/mango'`

from terminal would give the following result.

```
{
    "word": "mango",
    "mnDef": "Тайлбар олдсонгүй",
    "enDef": [
        "a juicy tropical fruit that has firm yellow and red skin and a hard seed at its center"
    ],
    "prs": {
        "hw": "man*go",
        "prs": [
            {
                "ipa": "ˈmæŋgoʊ",
                "sound": {
                    "audio": "mango001"
                }
            }
        ]
    },
    "examples": []
}
